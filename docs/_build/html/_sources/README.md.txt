The python version reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm.

Currently supported: Multi-objective minimization with visualization and interaction support. Preference is accepted as a reference point.

To test the code, open the [binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/EchoBetaGlass/pyrvea/master) and read example.ipynb.
